"""
microsearch
===========
A small search library.
Primarily intended to be a learning tool to teach the fundamentals of search.
Usage
-----
Example::
    import microsearch
    # Create an instance, pointing it to where the data should be stored.
    ms = microsearch.Microsearch('/tmp/microsearch')
    # Index some data.
    ms.index('email_1', {'text': "Peter,\n\nI'm going to need those TPS reports on my desk first thing tomorrow! And clean up your desk!\n\nLumbergh"})
    ms.index('email_2', {'text': 'Everyone,\n\nM-m-m-m-my red stapler has gone missing. H-h-has a-an-anyone seen it?\n\nMilton'})
    ms.index('email_3', {'text': "Peter,\n\nYeah, I'm going to need you to come in on Saturday. Don't forget those reports.\n\nLumbergh"})
    ms.index('email_4', {'text': 'How do you feel about becoming Management?\n\nThe Bobs'})
    # Search on it.
    ms.search('Peter')
    ms.search('tps report')
Documents
---------
Documents are dictionaries & look like::
    # Keys are field names.
    # Values are the field's contents.
    {
        "id": "document-1524",
        "text": "This is a blob of text. Nothing special about the text, just a typical document.",
        "created": "2012-02-18T20:19:00-0000",
    }
The Index
---------
The (inverted) index itself (represented by the segment file bits), is also
essentially a dictionary. The difference is that the index is term-based, unlike
the field-based nature of the document::
    # Keys are terms.
    # Values are document/position information.
    index = {
        'blob': {
            'document-1524': [3],
        },
        'text': {
            'document-1524': [5, 10],
        },
        ...
    }
For this library, on disk, this is represented by a large number of small
segment files. You hash the term in question & take the first 6 chars of the
hash to determine what segment file it should be in. Those files are
maintained in alphabetical order. They look something like::
    blob\t{'document-1523': [3]}\n
    text\t{'document-1523': [5, 10]}\n
